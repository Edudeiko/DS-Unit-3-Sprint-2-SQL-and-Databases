# In particular note that the *primary* key is `Id`, and not `CustomerId`. On
# other tables (where it is a *foreign* key) it will be `CustomerId`. Also note -
# the `Order` table conflicts with the `ORDER` keyword! We'll just avoid that
# particular table, but it's a good lesson in the danger of keyword conflicts.

# Part 4 - Questions (and your Answers)


# 1). In the Northwind database, what is the type of relationship between the
# `Employee` and `Territory` tables?
# --- Many-to-many relationship

# 2). What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB) is appropriate, and
# what is a situation where it is not appropriate?
# --- MongoDB is a NOSQL database, it is appropriate only for a BIG data. It is not 
# appropriate for if you need to update more than one document or collection per user request.

# 3). What is "NewSQL", and what is it trying to achieve?
# --- is a new approach to relational databases that wants to combine
# transactional ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)
# guarantees of good olâ€™ RDBMSs and the horizontal scalability of NoSQL.
